# A practical deep learning tutorial for beginners
This is a tutorial for getting started with deep learning using Tensorflow2 and Keras, created by Siiri Rautio, University of Helsinki.

The tutorial has the following parts:

## Part 1: Installing Tensorflow and necessary packages
Choose either ```part1_linux```, ```part1_ Windows```, or ```part1_MacOS``` based on your operating system, and follow the instructions.

## Part 2: Trying out example codes and experimenting
There are three different projects you can choose from:
```part2a_superresolution```: superresolution with ellipses, 
```part2b_deblurring```: deblurring with ellipses, 
```part2a_sinogram_interpolation```: computer tomography sinogram interpolation.

The ellipse dataset of 5000 .mat-files can be downloaded from Dropbox:

As well as the dataset of 5000 sinogram .mat-files:

## Part 3: Using your own data
Experiment with your own data, solving problems that are relevant for you. Use the codes from part2 as a staring point. 
If you don't have a problem of your own you wish to solve, you can for example try learning computed tomography reconstruction, using ```part3_project```. 
Here is some data for this, ellipses that correspond to the inverse Radon transform of the previous sinograms:
